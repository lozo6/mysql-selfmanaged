HHA 504 Assignment 5

Part 1 â€“ Installing MySQL on either Azure or GCP VM

Create a new public github repo called 'mysql-selfmanaged' in your github account. In this exercise, you will create a new VM and install MySQL onto that VM, configure it to allow external connections, and then upload via python a dummy dataset into a dummy database within MySQL.

Inside the folder, create a readme.md file that contains the following instructions/details: 

What cloud environment you decided to use

How you set up your VM (what image you selected - imagine writing a brief tutorial to a new user - what would you include and how to quickly and easily set up a new VM) 

The commands you used to setup the OS image (how did you update the OS image? how did you install the mysql

What changes you needed to make in order to make the mysql instance available to external computers (config file? opening ports?)

An example dataset that you have found (selected) to insert into the mysql database (provide the sqlalchemy/python code used to upload/insert the data) [there is no limitations, min/max of what I am looking for here] ---- REMINDER: in your python file, you will likely have to provide credentials, please use a .ENV file to load credentials so you do not hard-code the passwords/usernames into your github repo] [example python file for connecting/creating: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MPkNpvwzJgjcQ2fE8AUSOltPt6FtGvRB?usp=sharing] 


## How to set up VM with MySQL

I will be using Microsoft Azure for this tutorial, but you can also Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Create a Virtual Machine (VM) with minimum requirements for installing MySQL in Linux environment (Ubuntu)
